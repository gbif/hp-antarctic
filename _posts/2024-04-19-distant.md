Introducing the SCAR DistAnt Ecological Model Output Repository, a collaborative effort from the [SCAR Expert Group on Biodiversity Informatics](https://scar.org/science/life/egabi), the IDEA ([AAD](https://www.antarctica.gov.au/science/), Australia) and the ADVANCE ([INS](https://www.naturalsciences.be/en), Belgium) initiatives. This [repository](https://github.com/SCAR/distant) serves as a new resource for scientists delving into the unique ecosystems of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. 

Explore a collection of model outputs, including circum-Antarctic species distribution models, presented in a cloud-optimized format (COGs) with original data integrity preserved! With useful metadata provided for each layer, you can efficiently navigate taxonomic and spatial coverage, model output types, and more. Downloading data is streamlined, with options for zipped formats available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10946892) or direct access to individual layers on [Source Cooperative](https://beta.source.coop/repositories/scar/distant/description/), allowing seamless integration into research workflows and swift utilization of relevant ecological model outputs.

Weâ€™re keen on contributions from the community! Share your valuable data with us by simply opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SCAR/distant). We prioritize circumpolar layers but we welcome regional insights that fill gaps in taxonomic or output variable coverage.

The news is also posted in [SCAR EG-ABI news](https://scar.org/scar-news/life-sciences/eg-abi-news/model-output-repository).
