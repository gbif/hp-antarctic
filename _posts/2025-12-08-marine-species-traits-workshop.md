The **SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal**, in partnership with the **SCAR Expert Group on Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics**, **SCARfish** and **World Register of Marine Species (Register of Antarctic Marine Species)**, will organise a hybrid workshop on Southern Ocean species traits from **March 30 to April 2 or 3**.

The workshop's purpose is to collect trait data on **Antarctic marine species, with a focus on, but not limited to, fish**.

Hereby, we warmly invite you to participate in this workshop. During this four or five-day session, we want to concentrate on making Species Trait data public. For this, we shall focus on:

1. Getting a hands-on understanding of how to integrate and make trait data available using systems such as Fishbase and WoRMS.
2. Develop a strategy for making such data available and update the list of priority traits.
3. Finally, the goal is to work on reviewing sources of trait data and making trait data available.

You can apply for in-person participation, and we have a limited funds to support some of the participants' travel fees to Belgium. Remote involvement is encouraged as well.

**Please complete the following form to apply for a spot:
