As part of the [10th SCAR Open Science Conference of 2022](https://scar2022.org/) (1-10 august 2022) we are hosting a [satellite event](https://scar2022.org/satellite-events/) on **Structuring and Managing Biological Data.** That will take place **Monday, 8th August 2022, 13:00-14:30 UTC**

The Antarctic and Sub Antarctic region are hosts to unique biodiversity. Due to the remoteness and harsh environment, this biodiversity often remains poorly described despite similar threats to the rest of the globe. As such The biodiversity data collected in this region is of high scientific value.

This workshop aims to train scientists to structure and manage their biological data more effectively and conform to internationally used biodiversity data standard formats, saving precious time in preparing data for analysis or online archiving.

This workshop is organised by the SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal in the framework of the [topical collection "Antarctic and Southern Ocean biodiversity"](https://www.biodiversity.aq/news/antarctic-and-southern-ocean-biodiversity-topical-collection-biodiversity-data-journal/) of the Pensoft "Biodiversity Data Journal".

**Monday, 8th August 2022, 13:00-14:30 UTC**
