# SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATOR ANTARCTIC AND SOUTHERN OCEAN BIODIVERSITY (m/f/x)

There is 1 vacancy at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, within the department of Biodiversity & Ecosystems Data & Information Centre (BEDIC).

The function's activity group is: I – scientific research and experimental development

## Context

The Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences is recruiting a scientific collaborator to support the implementation of a Virtual Research Environment for Monitoring and reporting on biodiversity changes in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic Region.

We are currently seeking a skilled and motivated Biodiversity Data Analyst with expertise in programming languages such as R and Python to expand our team further. As part of our team, you will play a key role in developing analytical workflows for biodiversity research using public data repositories like OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) and GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility).

This function is part of the BELSPO-funded Antarctic bioDiVersity dAta iNfrastruCturE (ADVANCE) Project. ADVANCE will work towards improved coordination and interoperability of diverse tools and facilities that operate worldwide and turn Southern Ocean and Antarctic biodiversity data into research and policy-relevant data products.

ADVANCE is a collaboration between SOOS, the Australian Antarctic Division, EMODnet, WoRMS, as well as GBIF, and OBIS to create a Virtual Research Infrastructure (VRI) for the Antarctic and Southern Ocean (ASO) region that will convert biodiversity data into research and policy-relevant data products.

ADVANCE supports the publication of all research cycle elements in accordance with open science principles like FAIR, TRUST, and CARE: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR), Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability and Technology (TRUST), and Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics (CARE).

It will expand a well-established online data platform (the SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal, www.biodiversity.aq) to meet the growing needs of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean biodiversity research community to access high-quality data, services, protocols, standards, workflows, and software/applications that integrate biodiversity data with environmental data from diverse sources and create research and policy-relevant outputs.

A key component will be the development of applications that allow data product creation from Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs), Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), and Ecosystem Essential Ocean Variables (eEOVs) will be crucial. These will be integrated into various international platforms including SOOS and SOOSmap.
