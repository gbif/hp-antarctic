# SCAR Antarctic Wildlife Health Network Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 Database

The Antarctic Wildlife Health Network ([AWHN](https://scar.org/science/life/awhn)) has established a HPAI database to monitor and record information submitted to the AWHN on the spread of HPAI outbreaks in the sub-Antarctic and Antarctica throughout the 2023/24 Austral Summer. 
This database forms a central reporting database to collate detailed scientific information on all suspected and confirmed outbreaks throughout the sub-Antarctic and Antarctica. 
[EG-ABI](https://scar.org/science/life/egabi) helped develop a web application to visualise suspected and confirmed cases.
The AWHN will also provide regular updates on current cases and recommendations.
