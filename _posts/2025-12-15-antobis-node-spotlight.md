The Antarctic OBIS Node ([biodiversity.aq](biodiversity.aq)) was recently interviewed by the OBIS Secretariat as part of their series highlighting OBIS nodes worldwide.

In this interview, [Anton Van de Putte](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1336-5554) (Node Manager) and [Yi-Ming Gan](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7087-2646) (Data Manager) reflect on the role of Antarctic OBIS in mobilising and publishing marine biodiversity data from the Southern Ocean. They discuss how nearly two decades of sustained data stewardship, close collaboration with international partners, and the Node’s dual engagement with OBIS and GBIF help ensure that Antarctic biodiversity data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for science, policy, and conservation.

The interview also touches on current challenges in Antarctic data management, the importance of trust and long-term collaboration with data providers, and future directions such as work on Essential Ocean Variables and policy-relevant data products.
