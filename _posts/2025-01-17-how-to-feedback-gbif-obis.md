If you encounter issues or have suggestions for data published via GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) or OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System), hereâ€™s how you can provide feedback:

## Feedback for GBIF Data

On any GBIF page, you can click on the feedback button (circled in orange in the screenshot below) and submit your feedback. Note that you will need a GBIF account to do this.

A form (as shown in the screenshot below) will appear, where you can provide your feedback following the instructions.

Alternatively, you can report feedback through GBIF's dedicated GitHub repository: [https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues](https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues).

The feedback will be directed to the GBIF Helpdesk, which will follow up on the matter.

## Feedback for OBIS data

Feedback for OBIS data is preferred to be submitted through its dataset page. OBIS dataset page links are prefixed with https://obis.org/dataset/ followed by the dataset's UUID. From there, you can provide feedback by clicking the "report issue" button (circled in red in the screenshot below).
