A new quick start guide is now available to help enhance the discovery and reuse of survey and monitoring data! Whether you're working with biodiversity data or environmental research, this guide provides key insights and best practices.

We would like to congratulate and acknowledge the efforts of everyone involved in developing both the [Humboldt Extension](https://eco.tdwg.org/) and this [new guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-7t3p-ve38). A member of our team contributed to this effort as part of the [Humboldt Extension Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/humboldt-extension/), which played a key role in developing the extension. The time dedicated by our team member to this work is supported by the ADVANCE project, funded by [BELSPO](https://www.belspo.be/) (BELSPO project RT/23/ADVANCE). We would like to acknowledge and thank BELSPO for their support.
