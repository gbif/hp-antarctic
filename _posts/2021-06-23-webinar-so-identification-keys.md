The Antarctic Biodiversity Portal organised a webinar “Increasing availability and digitization of identification keys for the Southern Ocean”.

The webinar took place on Wednesday 23rd of June 2021 and was attended by 33 participants from around the world.

Presenters illustrated the importance and interest of e-taxonomy, with a specific focus on [Xper3](https://xper3.fr/), a dedicated platform to create identification keys (open-access and collaborative, polytomous logic, tools assessing the efficiency of the key …). Overall presentations were realized alongside illustrations of recent case studies of Southern Ocean keys. A time slot was also devoted to showcasing how to create Xper3 keys as well as how to use the platform.
