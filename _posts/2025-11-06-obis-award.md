In news that precisely no one asked for, Ming who has been quietly working behind the scenes on data models, quality checks, and sheer persistence, has received an OBIS Community Hero Award.
She did not ask for this recognition, but apparently competence has consequences.

“I’m so thrilled,” Ming said, with an expressionless face.

When nobody even asked if this makes her a biodiversity hero, Ming replied,

> “Not all heroes wear capes. I do not wear a cape for this exact reason,”

maintaining an even more expressionless face.

This post exists because data managers rarely get acknowledged,
because funders require evidence that activities occurred,
and because project reports don’t write themselves.

So here it is — partly for the record,
and partly so people know Ming is, in fact, capable.

OBIS hasn’t made a news post about this yet, probably because Ming is just that efficient.
