# SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal is now a GBIF Hosted Portal

Welcome to the new SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal!

We are excited to introduce you to our brand new portal, which replaces the old system that was becoming increasingly costly to maintain. As part of our ongoing commitment to providing you with the best possible experience, we have migrated to the [GBIF hosted portal](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals), offering enhanced features and improved performance.

We would like to express our sincere appreciation to GBIF for providing us with this exceptional service and hosting our new portal.

Important Changes:

## Account and Data Deletion
We regret to inform you that your account on the old portal, along with all associated data, has been deleted. This step was necessary to ensure a seamless transition to the new portal. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. To continue to use the download services, we kindly request you to create a new account on GBIF.

## GBIF Integration
The new portal is now integrated with GBIF, a globally recognized platform for biodiversity data. By creating a GBIF account, you can easily access and download data from our portal. GBIF offers a secure and reliable environment for managing biodiversity data from around the world. If you don't have a GBIF account yet, we encourage you to create one for seamless access to our portal and other valuable resources within the GBIF network.

## Improved Downloads with DOIs
Unlike the old portal, all downloads from the new portal will now come with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). This DOI allows you to cite the downloaded data, ensuring proper attribution and fostering collaboration among researchers. 

We understand that this transition may require some adjustment, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused during this process. Our team is dedicated to assisting you throughout this transition and ensuring a smooth experience. Should you encounter any difficulties or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at data-biodiversity-aq(a)naturalsciences.be.

We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to GBIF for their collaboration and for offering us this service. Their support has been instrumental in making this transition possible.

We are grateful for your understanding and continued support as we strive to deliver an improved user experience and provide you with efficient access to biodiversity data.

Thank you for being a part of the SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal community!
