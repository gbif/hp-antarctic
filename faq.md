### Which data can be shared through SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal?

> We can assist and support publication of biodiversity from Antarctica, sub Antarctic island(s) and in the Southern Ocean to [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and [OBIS](https://www/obis.org/). This includes dataset descriptions, organism occurrences, species checklists, DNA-derived occurrences and sampling events. 
> Please have a look at this [blog post](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/data-shareability/) for more details.
> If you have other data types, but you are not sure where and how to make it available,
> please [email us](mailto:data-biodiversity-aq@naturalsciences.be) so that we can direct you to people who may be able to
> help you.

### Which data standard is used to share biodiversity data?

> We use the [Darwin Core (DwC) standard](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) and associated extensions to publish biodiversity data
> and associated data (e.g. links to media, sequences). If you would like to publish your biodiversity data with us but
> unsure how to map your data to Darwin Core and its extensions, please contact
> our [helpdesk](mailto:data-biodiversity-aq@naturalsciences.be).

### What is the scope of this portal?

> The [occurrence records](/occurrence/search) in this portal are all occurrences in GBIF **within**
> the [MEASO polygon](https://github.com/gbif/hp-antarctic/blob/eea6740b87e477305107cf702055e01a0b4691d8/_includes/js/config.js#L32).

### What is the criteria for a dataset to be added to [SCAR network](https://www.gbif.org/network/8534dd20-c368-4a1f-bdaf-e6b390710f89)?

> Dataset that includes biological observations of the Antarctic continent, sub Antarctic island(s) and in the Southern
> Ocean are encouraged to be added to the [SCAR network](https://www.gbif.org/network/8534dd20-c368-4a1f-bdaf-e6b390710f89). 
> There is no restriction on the type of primary biodiversity data.

### What is the criteria for a dataset to be added to [OBIS network](https://www.gbif.org/network/2b7c7b4f-4d4f-40d3-94de-c28b6fa054a6)?

> Dataset that includes biological observations of the Southern Ocean are encouraged to be added to the [OBIS network](https://www.gbif.org/network/2b7c7b4f-4d4f-40d3-94de-c28b6fa054a6). 
> There is no restriction on the type of primary biodiversity data.
>Data must adhere to guidelines to contribute to OBIS, for more details see the [OBIS manual](https://manual.obis.org/).
 
### What is the taxonomic backbone of the taxa in this portal?

> Since all occurrence records comes from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), the scientific names and taxonomy are according
> to [GBIF Backbone Taxonomy](https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei).
> Where possible we encourage the use of the register of Antarctic species [RAS](https://ras.biodiversity.aq) and the register of Antarctic Marine Species [RAMS](https://www.marinespecies.org/rams/) for validating sceintific names and taxonomy.

### Can I access the data of this portal programmatically?

> Yes! All species occurrence records in this portal are from GBIF. You can access the data programmatically using its
> API documented [here](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/). A beginners guide is available
> at [GBIF data blog](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-api-beginners-guide/).


### Is the SCAR Antarctic biodiversity Portal (biodiversity.aq) the same as SCAR MarBIN?

>Before biodiversity.aq, there was SCAR-MarBIN. SCAR-MarBIN had a website and a database, but they are no longer being updated. When SCAR-MarBIN was made, the GBIF portal didn't have as many options as it does now. During that time, SCAR-MarBIN was able to meet the needs of its users. It is no longer needed since GBIF has grown and added more features.
